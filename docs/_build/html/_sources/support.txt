========

nDeploy is licensed under GPLv3.
Users can install and use the product for free.
There is no need to purchase any recurring license to install or use nDeploy.
There is no seperate version of nDeploy provided with a different feature set.

The people behind nDeploy provide their expertise in installing and setting up the software
commercially. *This is like you getting a Jumbo Jet for free but hiring a pilot to fly it.*

Commercial Support for nDeploy, nDeploy-cluster, DuET cPanel, etc is available with the purchase of a SysAdmin Plan
at `https://sysally.net/plans/ <https://sysally.net/plans/>`_.

**Community Support**

*This is like you getting advice from fellow pilots and flying the airplane on your own.*
