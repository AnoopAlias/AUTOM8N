Monitoring nginx and app servers
=================================

**Monitoring nginX**

The server is already configured on localhost to send the nginx status at nginx_status URL

lynx http://localhost/nginx_status

on the server cli will show the status .
Local checks (for example the check_mk nginx status module) should just report
the details fine to remote monitoring servers.

**Monitoring php-fpm**

php-fpm can be configured to provide detailed status info per pool.
But since this has its own data confidentiality risks
this is not enabled by default on the php-fpm pool config file.
But all php-based templated include a location block to give a ping signal to php-fpm
and the fpm pool is setup to respond with a pong

http://domain.com/pingphpfpm

will return with a pong output if php-fpm pool is working fine .

This can be easily configured for status checking
