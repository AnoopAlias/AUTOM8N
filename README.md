# nDeploy
cpanel nginx plugin that lets you deploy PHP/Ruby/Python/NodeJS/ColdFusion and more!


Future plans:

1. Support CentOS 7 - this is not critical right now as cPanel itself doesnt support CentOS 7 as of now .
2. Move away from script based multi version installers like phpbrew,rvm,pythoz,nvm etc to rpm based https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/
